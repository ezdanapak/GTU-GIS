=== "Steps for assignement"
* Download Basemap files from [here](https://elearning.gtu.ge/pluginfile.php/572869/mod_folder/content/0/Basemaps_lyr.zip?forcedownload=1)
* Download the data from [here](https://elearning.gtu.ge/pluginfile.php/572869/mod_folder/content/0/GPS_AND_Photo.zip?forcedownload=1)
    
* Create necessary folders for the project from the starting point, or add more as needed during the workflow. Follow the file naming rules provided above. <br>
    - archive, 
    - GPS_coordinates, 
    - lyr, 
    - Project, 
    - Raster, 
    - shp,

``` mermaid
graph LR
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> B{archive};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> C{GPS_coordinates};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> D{Project};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> E{shp};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> F{Raster};
  F --> J[GeoTaggedphoto];
```


* Import GPS coordinates as a shapefile. <br>
* Import geotagged photos as a shapefile. <br>
* Create hyperlinks on the photos layer and display photos as pop-ups. <br>
* Delete unnecessary fields from the layers, either using the attribute table or ArcToolbox. <br>
* Convert the photos layer from the ellipsoid to the UTM zone and calculate XY coordinates in the layer table using ArcToolbox or manual methods. <br>
* Save project file named as "GPS_photo_coordinates". Save another mxd file for old versions "GPS_photo_coordinates10.0v".
* You can Geotag photos manualy on the web [site](https://tool.geoimgr.com/)
