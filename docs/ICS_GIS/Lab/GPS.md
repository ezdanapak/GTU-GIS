(GPS_AND_Photo.rar)

=== "Steps for assignement"
    * Create necessary folders for the project from the starting point, or add more as needed during the workflow. <br>
    * Import GPS coordinates as a shapefile. <br>
    * Import geotagged photos as a shapefile. <br>
    * Create FileGeodatabase, import shapefiles and save project file named as "GPS.mxd".
    * Create hyperlinks on the photos layer and display photos as pop-ups. <br>
    * Delete unnecessary fields from the layers, either using the attribute table or ArcToolbox. <br>
    * Convert the photos layer from the ellipsoid to the UTM zone and calculate XY coordinates in the layer table using ArcToolbox or manual methods. <br>
