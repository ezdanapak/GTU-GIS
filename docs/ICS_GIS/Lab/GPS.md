## Assignment Instructions

‚ö†Ô∏è **Work Environment**

On university computers, work inside the folder:  
`C:\Users\Public\` or `C:\Users\Public\Documents`  
*(This is recommended even on personal computers, as the program may encounter issues when files are located elsewhere.)*

üì¶ **Required Software**

* ArcGIS ‚Äì Required ‚úÖ  
* Google Earth ‚Äì Optional (depending on the task) ‚úÖ

    **File Naming Rules**

    ‚ùå **Incorrect:**  

    Giorgi Kapanadze.Group/1$ work1  

    ‚ùå Do not use:

    - Georgian characters (·Éê, ·Éë, ·Éí, ·Éì, etc.)  
    - Special symbols (other than an underscore `_`)

    ‚úÖ **Correct:**

    Giorgi_Kapanadze_Group_4_work_1  

!!!tip
    Use only Latin letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`) for:  
    Archive names, folder and file names, and table column names.

## üìò Step-by-Step Guide

!!!note
    You must be authorized (logged in) on [elearning.gtu.ge](https://elearning.gtu.ge) to download the data.


=== "Steps for assignement"
* Download Basemap files from [here](https://elearning.gtu.ge/pluginfile.php/572869/mod_folder/content/0/Basemaps_lyr.zip?forcedownload=1)
* Download the data from [here](https://elearning.gtu.ge/pluginfile.php/572869/mod_folder/content/0/GPS_AND_Photo.zip?forcedownload=1)
    
* Create necessary folders for the project from the starting point, or add more as needed during the workflow. Follow the file naming rules provided above. <br>
    - archive, 
    - GPS_coordinates, 
    - lyr, 
    - Project, 
    - Raster, 
    - shp,

``` mermaid
graph LR
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> B{archive};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> C{GPS_coordinates};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> D{Project};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> E{shp};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> F{Raster};
  F --> J[GeoTaggedphoto];
```


* Import GPS coordinates as a shapefile. <br>
* Import geotagged photos as a shapefile. <br>
 * Create hyperlinks on the photos layer and display photos as pop-ups. <br>
* - Delete unnecessary fields from the layers, either using the attribute table or ArcToolbox. <br>
* - Convert the photos layer from the ellipsoid to the UTM zone and calculate XY coordinates in the layer table using ArcToolbox or manual methods. <br>
* Save project file named as "GPS_photo_coordinates". Save another mxd file for old versions "GPS_photo_coordinates10.0v".
* You can Geotag photos manualy on the web [site](https://tool.geoimgr.com/)
