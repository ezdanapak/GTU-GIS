Selection Tools in GIS

Select by Attributes:

Purpose: Select parcels based on values in the attribute table.
How to:
Use two conditions (for example, equal to and greater than) to filter the data.
Options available: Reselect and Unselect buttons for modifying your selection.
SQL Query with Operators:

Purpose: Use SQL queries to select features with specific conditions.
How to:
Create SQL queries with operators (e.g., =, >, <, AND, OR) to filter your selection.
Save the query for future use and use the Expression Builder for advanced querying.
Difference between sources (shp, mdb, gdb) when selecting data and saving query.
Sort attribute fields to help identify which values to filter.
Filter layers to narrow down your data within the window.
Select by Location:

Purpose: Select features geographically, based on spatial relationships.
How to:
Use options like Clip to extract data or Export to save the selected features.
You can select parcels that intersect, are within a certain distance, or share specific spatial relationships.
Select by Graphics:

Purpose: Select spatial features using graphical objects.
How to:
Create graphical objects (such as circles, rectangles, or polygons) to define a selection area.
Select features that fall within the defined graphical boundary.
Interactive Selection:

Purpose: A dynamic method for selecting features based on attributes or location.
How to:
Combine both Attribute and Location selection methods for more precise and interactive selection.
Select Features Tool (GUI - White Arrow):

Purpose: Use the selection arrow tool in the toolbar for various selection types.
How to:
Select specific features interactively using the white arrow on the toolbar.
This tool provides different selection options based on geometry and attributes.
ArcToolbox:

Purpose: Use additional tools for feature selection.
How to:
In ArcToolbox, go to SelectLayerByAttribute or SelectLayerByLocation.
Use these tools for more advanced, scripted selections based on attributes or location.
Data Use:

Purpose: Use the provided dataset for selection tasks.
How to:
Use the Chiatura_Selection.gdb.rar file to practice the above selection techniques.
