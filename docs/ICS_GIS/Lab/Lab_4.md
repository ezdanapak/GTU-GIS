## Basic Raster Styling and Analysis (QGIS3)
A lot of scientific observations and research produces raster datasets. Rasters are grids of pixels that have a specific value assigned to them. By doing mathematical operations on these values, one can do some interesting analysis. QGIS has some basic analysis capabilities built-in via Raster Calculator. In this tutorial, we will explore the options available for styling rasters and functionality provided by the raster calculator.
