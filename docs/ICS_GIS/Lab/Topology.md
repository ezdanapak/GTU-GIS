## An overview of topology in ArcGIS

If you have features that are coincident and share the same location of coordinates, boundaries, or nodes, chances are that geodatabase topology can help you better manage your geographic data.

!!!note
    You must be authorized (logged in) on [elearning.gtu.ge](https://elearning.gtu.ge) to download the data.

=== "Step I: Folder Setup"
* Download shapefiles from [here](https://elearning.gtu.ge/pluginfile.php/572869/mod_folder/content/0/chiatura_OSM_topology.zip?forcedownload=1)
* Create new geodatabase "mynewgeodatabase" and create inside dataset, name it "topology".
* Create Topology and some base rules as you need:
    - polygon Must not have gaps
    - Must not overlap
    - line Must not self-overlap
    - Must not self-intersect 
    - point Must be properly inside
    - Must be covered by boundary of



In new dataset import spatial data for validation and correction. <br>
    Define topology rules and save in a predefined folder. <br>
    Validate topology. <br>
    Correct errors as needed. <br>
    Correct errors as needed. <br>

* Building Project (with Necessary Folders) and Naming Convention:

Project Name: My_project
Folders:
shp
project
Geodatabase
Topology rules

* Properly saving the project file. Name it "Topology_project". Save another mxd file for old versions "Topology_project10.0v".


=== "Step III: Final Checks & Submission"

* Compress (zip) your folder (named after your first and last name). 💾
* Use formats like `.rar` or `.zip`.
* Name the archive as:  
  `FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number`

* Send it to: giorgi.kapanadze@gtu.ge
