# Vector data editing. Topological Storage of Vector Data. Topology. The Example of DIME. 

## An overview of topology in ArcGIS

If you have features that are coincident and share the same location of coordinates, boundaries, or nodes, chances are that geodatabase topology can help you better manage your geographic data.

## Assignment Instructions

⚠️ **Work Environment**

On university computers, work inside the folder:  
`C:\Users\Public\` or `C:\Users\Public\Documents`  
*(This is recommended even on personal computers, as the program may encounter issues when files are located elsewhere.)*

📦 **Required Software**

* ArcGIS – Required ✅  
* Google Earth – Optional (depending on the task) ✅

!!!warning
    Do not delete completed work until the end of the semester.

    **File Naming Rules**

    ❌ **Incorrect:**  

    Giorgi Kapanadze.Group/1$ work1  

    ❌ Do not use:

    - Georgian characters (ა, ბ, გ, დ, etc.)  
    - Special symbols (other than an underscore `_`)

    ✅ **Correct:**

    Giorgi_Kapanadze_Group_4_work_1  

!!!tip
    Use only Latin letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`) for:  
    Archive names, folder and file names, and table column names.

## 📘 Step-by-Step Guide

!!!note
    You must be authorized (logged in) on [elearning.gtu.ge](https://elearning.gtu.ge) to download the data.

=== "Step I: Folder Setup"
* We are using a **Geodatabase [task](https://ezdanapak.github.io/GTU-GIS/ICS_GIS/Lab/Geodatabase/)** as part of this exercise.
* Rename main folder from geodatabase to topology. Example "Giorgi_Kapanadze_Group_4_work_5_topology" <br>
* Correct sources if it needed. <br>
* Also download shapefiles from [here](https://elearning.gtu.ge/pluginfile.php/572869/mod_folder/content/0/chiatura_OSM_topology.zip?forcedownload=1)
* Add inside project additional necessary folders:
    - Topology_rules

``` mermaid
graph LR
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> B{Archive};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> C{Project};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> D{lyr};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> E{shp};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> F{Geodatabase};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> G{Style};
  A[FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number] --> H{Topology_rules};
```

* Create inside existing geodatabase new dataset, name it "topology".
* Create Topology and some base rules as you need:
    * For polygon <br>
    - Must not have gaps <br>
    - Must not overlap <br>
    * For line <br>
    - line Must not self-overlap <br>
    - Must not self-intersect <br>
    * For point <br>
    - point Must be properly inside <br>
    - Must be covered by boundary of <br>



* In new dataset import spatial data(shp that downloaded before) for validation and correction. <br>
* Define topology rules and save them in a predefined folder. <br>
* Validate topology, add in project. <br>
* Correct errors and make exceptions as needed. <br>
* Properly saving the project file. Name it "Topology_project". Save another mxd file for old versions "Topology_project10.0v".


=== "Step III: Final Checks & Submission"

* Compress (zip) your folder (named after your first and last name). 💾
* Use formats like `.rar` or `.zip`.
* Name the archive as:  
  `FirstName_LastName_GroupNumber_Assignment_Number`

* Send it to: giorgi.kapanadze@gtu.ge
