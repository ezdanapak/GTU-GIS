| Category               | Spatial Resolution                                | Spectral Resolution                                        | Temporal Resolution                                      | Radiometric Resolution                                       |

| 📌 **Definition**       | Size of the ground area represented by a pixel     | Ability to resolve and separate wavelengths in the EM spectrum | Frequency of image acquisition for the same location    | Sensitivity to detect subtle differences in reflected/emitted energy |
| 📏 **Measured As**      | Pixel size (e.g., 10 m, 30 m, 0.5 m)               | Number, width, and location of spectral bands               | Time interval between observations (e.g., 1 day, 5 days) | Number of bits per pixel (e.g., 8-bit = 256 levels)              |
| 📈 **High Resolution Means** | Smaller pixels; more spatial detail              | More, narrower bands across the spectrum                    | More frequent data capture (shorter revisit)             | Greater ability to detect subtle radiance differences             |
| 🎯 **Typical Use Cases** | Urban mapping, precision agriculture, habitat delineation | Crop species classification, mineral detection, vegetation indices | Change detection, phenological studies, emergency response | Monitoring crop stress, water turbidity, thermal variation         |
| 📷 **Examples**         | WorldView-3 (0.31 m), Sentinel-2 (10 m), Landsat 8 (30 m) | AVIRIS (224 bands), Hyperion (220), Sentinel-2 (13 bands)  | MODIS (1–2 days), Sentinel-2 (5 days), Landsat 8 (16 days) | Landsat 8 (12-bit), Sentinel-2, MODIS (12–16 bit)                |
| 💾 **Impact on File Size** | Higher resolution = larger files due to more pixels | More bands = larger multispectral/hyperspectral files      | Frequent captures = higher data volumes over time       | Higher bit depth = more data per pixel, increasing file size       |
| ⚖️ **Trade-offs**       | Higher detail reduces swath width and increases data size | Narrow bands increase noise and may reduce SNR             | High revisit often comes with lower spatial resolution   | Higher radiometric resolution increases data volume and processing load |
| ⚙️ **Affected By**       | Sensor design and altitude; optics; orbit geometry | Sensor filter technology; wavelength detection limits       | Satellite orbit (sun-synchronous, geostationary), swath width | Sensor electronics and analog-to-digital converter precision        |
| 🔗 **Related Concepts** | Ground Sampling Distance (GSD), pixel footprint   | Bandwidth, hyperspectral vs. multispectral                  | Temporal frequency, repeat cycle, temporal aliasing      | Digital Number (DN), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)                   |
