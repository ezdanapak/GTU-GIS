It involves assigning real-world coordinates to points on the map so that the map can be accurately used in spatial analysis.</p> <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how you can perform a practical task of georeferencing a topographic map, typically using GIS software like ArcGIS:</p> <p>Steps to Georeference a Topographic Map 1. Obtain the Topographic Map You need to have a scanned image or digital copy of the topographic map (typically in formats like JPEG, TIFF, or PNG).</p> <ol> <li>Requirements ArcGIS Desktop (ArcMap)</li> </ol> <p>Scanned topographic map (Raster Image)</p> <p>Reference coordinate information (Coordinates, Control Points, or Graticule)</p> <ol> <li>Import the Topographic Map Open your GIS software and load the topographic map into your workspace:</li> </ol> <p>In ArcGIS, you can add the map to the \"ArcMap\" window.</p> <p>Enable the Georeferencing Toolbar</p> <p>Customize \u2192 Toolbars \u2192 Georeferencing In the Georeferencing toolbar:</p> <p>Layer: Select your raster image</p> <ol> <li>Define the Coordinate System Before starting the georeferencing process, make sure to define the coordinate system for the map. For most topographic maps, this will be in UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) or geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude).</li> </ol> <p>In ArcGIS, ensure that the map document is set to the appropriate coordinate system.</p> <ol> <li>Select Ground Control Points (GCPs) Ground Control Points are real-world locations with known coordinates that you can identify on both the topographic map and a reference map (such as Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or other accurate georeferenced maps).</li> </ol> <p>Georeferencing Toolbar \u2192 Add Control Points Click Point on Raster \u2192 Click Corresponding Point on Reference Layer</p> <p>For example, if there is a known mountain peak or a building with known GPS coordinates, that would be a GCP.</p> <ol> <li>Mark Control Points Using the GIS software, mark the same locations on both the topographic map and the reference map.</li> </ol> <p>Use at least 4 well-distributed GCPs.</p> <p>In ArcGIS, click on the \"Add Control Points\" tool and do the same for the reference map.</p> <ol> <li>Select the Transformation Method After marking enough control points (usually 3-4 points for an accurate transformation), choose the transformation method. Common methods include:</li> </ol> <p>Polynomial: A simple transformation if the map is only slightly distorted.</p> <p>Spline: A more complex method if the map has significant distortion.</p> <p>You can check the transformation accuracy with an error tolerance value (usually RMS error).</p> <p>Adjust Transformation Settings Use appropriate transformation methods:</p> <p>Method  When to Use 1st Order (Affine)  When minimal distortion required 2nd or 3rd Order Polynomial For complex distortions Spline  For rubber sheeting View Residual Error Check the RMS (Root Mean Square) Error in the Link Table.</p> <p>Georeferencing Toolbar \u2192 View Link Table Try to keep RMS Error as low as possible.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Run the Georeferencing Process Once the control points are in place, select the transformation method and apply the georeferencing. The software will stretch and distort the scanned map to align it with the reference map based on the control points.</p> </li> <li> <p>Export the Georeferenced Map After georeferencing, export the map as a georeferenced image file (TIFF, for example) that contains spatial data. The image will now have geographic coordinates attached to it.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Georeferencing Toolbar \u2192 Rectify (creates new raster) or Georeferencing Toolbar \u2192 Update Georeferencing (saves transformation parameters)</p> <ol> <li>Verify the Accuracy To ensure that the georeferencing is accurate, you can compare the newly georeferenced map with other spatial data or by checking the locations of other known points. If needed, adjust the control points and reapply the georeferencing until the error is minimized.</li> </ol> <p>Additional Tips: Accuracy Check: If you can, use higher-resolution maps or more control points to improve accuracy.</p> <p>Topographic Features: Use visible features on the map (like rivers, road junctions, or hilltops) that are easier to identify and locate accurately on a reference map.</p> <p>By following these steps, you can successfully georeference a topographic map and overlay it on modern spatial data for analysis and mapping.</p> <p>Rectified GeoTIFF or updated Raster Dataset ready for analysis in GIS.</p>"},{"location":"ICS_GIS/Theory/Topic_1/","title":"Topic 1","text":""},{"location":"ICS_GIS/Theory/Topic_1/#about-ellipsoid","title":"About Ellipsoid","text":"<p>Check link &gt; Ellipsoid</p>"},{"location":"ICS_GIS/Theory/Topic_1/#about-earth-ellipsoid","title":"About Earth ellipsoid","text":"<p>Check link &gt; Earth ellipsoid</p>"},{"location":"ICS_GIS/Theory/Topic_2/","title":"Topic 2","text":"<p>What is map composition elements</p>"},{"location":"SMD_GIS/Info/","title":"Geographic Information Systems Fundamentals","text":"<p>This course is provided by the Faculty Of Sustainable Mountain Development  at Georgian Technical University.
